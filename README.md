Project Title: EduPreneur: AI-Driven Platform Connecting Student Entrepreneurs with Investors in South Africa

2.  Problem Statement: Higher learning institutions in South Africa are spewing brilliant innovative ideas and inventions by its students; such entrepreneurial ventures are poorly funded or recognized. As of now, there does not exist a single, accessible platform linking student entrepreneurs with investors interested in educational innovations. While students continue to grapple with finding the right investor for funding of their ideas, the investors find it hard to discover promising ventures.
