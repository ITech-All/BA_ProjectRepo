**Industry:** Education Industry
**Theme:** An AI Solution for Industries
**Project Title:** EduPreneur: AI-Driven Platform Connecting Student Entrepreneurs with Investors in South Africa

1. **Project Overview**
The AI platform is designed to connect students with innovative project ideas to investors. This system leverages AI to analyze the project details submitted by students and matches them with suitable investors based on project relevance, industry, and investor interests. The platform aims to streamline the process of finding investors for student-led innovations, encouraging investment in new, creative ideas.


2. **Problem Definition**
Many students have creative and innovative project ideas but lack the necessary funding or connections to bring their projects to life. On the other hand, investors are often looking for fresh, unique ideas to support, but they may not have easy access to projects aligned with their interests or industries. This disconnect creates a gap where students with promising projects struggle to find the necessary investment, while investors miss out on valuable opportunities.
By using AI, we aim to solve the problem of matching students with relevant investors more efficiently, thereby promoting innovation and helping students achieve success.


3. **AI Objective**
The main objective of this AI solution is to automatically match students' projects with suitable investors by analyzing the details of each project and comparing them to investor profiles. The AI system will consider several factors, including:
• The industry the project targets
• The potential market impact
• Investor preferences (such as industries of interest and investment amounts)
• Historical data of successful projects in similar industries

5. **Implementation Strategy**
**Step 1: Data Collection**
Collect data from students (project submissions) and investors (investment profiles). The data will include:
⦁	Industry type
⦁	Project description
⦁	Investment preferences This data will form the backbone of the matching and recommendation system.
**Step 2: Model Training**
Use machine learning to train the model on previous successful matches between students and investors, allowing it to learn which criteria matter most when connecting projects with the right investors.
**Step 3: NLP for Project Understanding**
Implement Natural Language Processing to automatically extract key information from student project descriptions, such as innovation type, market potential, and technical feasibility.
**Step 4: Machine Learning for Matching**
Develop the matching algorithm, which will compare the analyzed project data with investor profiles. Use algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) or Decision Trees to suggest suitable investors based on multiple factors like risk level and industry focus.
**Step 5: System Integration and Testing**
Test the AI platform to ensure that matches are relevant and refine the algorithm using feedback from both students and investors.
