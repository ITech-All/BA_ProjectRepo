**Project Title:** EduPreneur: AI-Driven Platform Connecting Student Entrepreneurs with Investors in South Africa

2.** Problem Definition**
Many students have creative and innovative project ideas but lack the necessary funding or connections to bring their projects to life. On the other hand, investors are often looking for fresh, unique ideas to support, but they may not have easy access to projects aligned with their interests or industries. This disconnect creates a gap where students with promising projects struggle to find the necessary investment, while investors miss out on valuable opportunities.
By using AI, we aim to solve the problem of matching students with relevant investors more efficiently, thereby promoting innovation and helping students achieve success.


3. **AI Objective**
The main objective of this AI solution is to automatically match students' projects with suitable investors by analyzing the details of each project and comparing them to investor profiles. The AI system will consider several factors, including:
• The industry the project targets
• The potential market impact
• Investor preferences (such as industries of interest and investment amounts)
• Historical data of successful projects in similar industries
